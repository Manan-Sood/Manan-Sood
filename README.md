### Hey, I am Manan Sood ðŸ‘‹

**I'm currently an undergrad student at BITS Pilani pursuing Computer Science and Economics!**

I am currently learning [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit) and [Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq).
I am an intern at [QWorld](https://qworld.net/) under the [QIntern](https://qworld.net/qintern-2021/) program working on a project about Quantum Annealing.
I am interested in the field of **Quantum Computing** and have completed [IBM's QxQ](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6q07z2fds7sek1n/Qubit%20by%20Qubit%20Certificate.pdf?dl=0), [QSilver Workshop](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o4r34s3fgr15okp/QSilver%20Manan%20Sood.jpg?dl=0) and [Qiskit Summer School 2021: Quantum Machine Learning](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tj920x6yynzff2h/QiskitGlobalSummerSchool_CertificateofQuantumExcellence_ID34_029000.pdf?dl=0).
I am looking for more learning opportunities and projects to collaborate on.
